# Antarctic Station Alpha-7 Mystery Scenes

## Plot Overview

David Martinez was promised the Station Commander position but it went to Dr. Sarah Chen instead. Bitter and resentful, Martinez sabotages the research server room during an incoming blizzard to destroy Sarah's climate research data and make her look incompetent. The explosion kills Dr. Tom Bradley instantly and cuts power, trapping Dr. James Wilson and Dr. Sarah Chen outside to freeze. The station splits into East Wing (Maria, Robert) and West Wing (Alex, Lisa, Hans, Martinez).

A massive blizzard rages for weeks, keeping both wings completely isolated. Martinez realizes his sabotage killed three people but is too afraid to confess. Food runs out gradually, leading to desperation and paranoia. When the blizzard finally clears, contact between wings turns violent. Alex kills Robert in self-defense, then murders Lisa in delusional rage after discovering her with a radio. Consumed by guilt, Alex hangs himself. Hans discovers Martinez's confession and strangles him in fury, becoming the sole survivor.
